This application can be running using the following commands:

Compilation:
	javac *.java
Execution:
	java TestProject

These two commands will allow the user to run the reservation system which is based on a series of menus and prompts.

The first menu that will appear is the login menu. Here you simply select the user type you wish to use and then enter the
the details for a user of that type. These details are stored in the SystemUsers.csv file. 

The next menu that appears will allow you to perform a series of actions depending on the privilages of the user type you have 
selected. Again you enter a number that represents the action that you wish to choose. Next you will either be prompted with
another menu, asked to enter certain information, or your chosen action will be performed. 

Dates: Any dates entered must be in the format day-month-year.

Explaination of analytics:
	-Financial: financial analytics are stored at cs4013project/analytics/financial. The user enters a start date and an end
		    date that they want analytics for and for each day in that range we output the expected income from reservations,		
		    the amount of money lost to cancellations and the amount gained from stays. At the bottom of the file there is also 
		    listed the totals of each category over the period.
	
	-Room Occupancy: As with the financial anylitics each row represents a day in the range entered by the user. Each column represents
			 a type of room.The data is represented as percentage occupancy of the type of room for each day.
			 Again totals are listed at the bottom of the file.
	
	-Hotel occupancy: The hotel occupancy is very similar to the room occupancy but instead of the columns representing room types,
			  they represent different hotels.
	  
details about validation:
  -A chekin has to happen on the correct day but a checkout can happen on any day because we assume that in real life the customer will leave on time or be kicked out.
  -If the user enters a room type that doesn't exist then the reservation cost will be zero. This can be considered an invalid reservation.
  -It is up to the user to input a correct room occupancy for a specified room. The format is validated but not the value.
